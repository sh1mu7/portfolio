        description: "Few weeks ago I came to know about Chingari from my team Privateyebd. We researched a bit about their concept, policy and exactly what they are doing. And at the end of the day we felt like, people should know about them. So what is Chingari? <br/>Chingari is the concept of freedom. There are trillions of content in the Internet, but none of them are owned by any normal person like us, rather than owned only by the Giant IT companies in the WORLD.The video you posted in YOUTUBE is owned by google, the picture you share in Facebook is owned by META. You may be the author of that video or picture but you are not the OWNER. And here chingari REVOLUTIONIST themselves, With their WEB3 and NFT technology for the fast time you can be the OWNER of your OWN CONTENT. In the Vast Ocean of information, now we can be the owner of the tiniest part of the internet. Also it revolutionize the Idea of NFT. To many people NFT is just a piece of art, or the way of making money, or a value. But what chingari represents redefined the idea of NFT. They Make it understandable that NFT is not just an art nor a value. Its an OWNERSHIP CONTRACT through NFT. Its not just art but you can virtually own anything despite your color, age, race or value. It can be a video or a picture of yours, It can be anything only limited by your imagination. Chingari made that dream happened. They are the first company in the world who gave the common people the power to own the internet. To own their own Content, their own video. That is what chingari is. It is FREEDOM.",
